The one thing we do not recommend is to collect your data through surveys - if you really want to do this, talk to us about it soon so we can see if that will work."

Then think of questions that you could answer using that dataset. If you don't find a question that you're interested in answering, or think that it may be difficult with the dataset, try moving to a different dataset and restart brainstorming. Keep in mind that usually, unexpected difficulties will arise during the analysis, so if you already have doubts before starting, that's a bad sign!\n",
